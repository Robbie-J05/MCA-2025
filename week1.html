    <h2 class="body-text">Access</h2>

<p class="body-text">
One thing I found difficult in this class was finding downloadable files for the exact music I was looking for. 
The Internet Archive was where I found most of my music in downloadable form, but if I were to research a 
lesser-known artist, I would likely face much more difficulty. Because this information is not usually sourced 
directly by the original artist or their producers—especially for older pieces—it is often provided by community 
members, which means it can sometimes be incorrect or unreliable.
</p>


<h2 class="body-text">Curation</h2>

<p class="body-text">
As mentioned above, track metadata can often be unreliable or sometimes completely missing. There is a large 
amount of data attached to music beyond just the sound itself, but the ability to navigate and analyse this 
data depends heavily on the quality of the information available. Another issue is differentiating between 
original versions, remastered tracks, live recordings, or cover versions when this information is not clearly 
specified, as each version contains very different data.
</p>


<h2 class="body-text">Distribution</h2>

<p class="body-text">
It is very rare for popular music platforms such as Spotify or Apple Music to provide data beyond album artwork 
and the song itself. Audio files also exist in many different formats. While WAV and MP3 are effective for storing 
audio, it is often necessary to create or source MIDI, MusicXML, or MEI files, which contain symbolic musical data 
used for analysis and notation rather than just listening.
</p>


<h2 class="body-text">Theme Connection: Pink Floyd</h2>

<p class="body-text">
My theme for this portfolio is the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Because they are a well-known and popular 
band, it was relatively easy to find both music and background information. However, even with a famous band, it 
is often a case of knowing where to look. Platforms such as the Internet Archive are not as widely known as 
Spotify, but they are extremely useful for obtaining downloadable music files for analysis.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
I was able to gather different tracks from the band’s catalogue as well as create a piece myself in MuseScore. 
One issue that can arise with older bands like Pink Floyd is that their work is largely pre-digital, meaning 
there was originally much less focus on metadata and file access. In addition, personal and legal disputes 
within the band—particularly around songwriting and accreditation—can complicate copyright and ownership data. 
Different recordings or covers of songs may credit different members, which is important to consider when 
creating and analysing music-related data.
