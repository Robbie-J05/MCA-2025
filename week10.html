    Analysis</h1>
  <p class="body-text">
    the transcription is pretty good at keeping the Rythmn of the piece despite it being in 7/4. It does however render it as 
    3/4 instead but yet somehow still stays rythmically accurate. The theme is still easy to notice but there are a lot of added
    dissonant pitches that have been picked up despite being taken from a synth (musescore). some times it plays octaves of the single line
    like at the end of bar 6 but the data has somehow been altered yet the general rythmn and pitch has somewhat remained. I also noticed
    it has extended the piece by holding the notes despite the original piece coming to an abrupt stop. the treble and bass cleft has also been
    mixed up somehow throughout the piece. finally i can see that the volume change has not been picked up in the transcription.
    while the track is still recognisable, some volume and timing data has been lost or corrupted, and some notes have been added despite
    not being in the original piece.
