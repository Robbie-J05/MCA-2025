  <p class="body-text">
    For this lab task I was asked to create a piece of music relating to my theme.</p>
   <p class="body-text"> I chose the song "Money" by Pink Floyd and made my own ten bars of the bassline in Musescore. 
    luckily I already have experience with Musescore and have had years of experience with music notation and software. i found that Musescore is very easy to use at a basic level,
    adding notes is very easy and changing their value and pitch is also simple.</p>
    
    <p class="body-text">One difficult part is how the software automatically uses rests to make sure the music stays "correct".
    This can be difficult if you are not familiar with the rules of notation and can be frustrating to make sure it sounds correct. For this exercise we simply needed to copy the music
    which meant thankfully you don't need much skill, only enough to be able to copy it exactly.</p>
    <p class="body-text">The 7/4 time signature was difficult as I had to make it myself since it was not on the 
    preset options. Overall it is a fun software to use at any level of music knowledge but to master it can be very difficult.<br><br>

    You can find my musescore file <a href="data/moneymuse.mscz"> here</a>
